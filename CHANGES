-changed world2voxel and voxel2world to include direction cosines
-added native_rhesus and paxinos_labels coordinate textfields
-added atlas label display textfield (and moved intensity display textfield beside it)
-added code to convert label intensity to anatomic label
-added code to convert between MNI_RHESUS, native_rhesus, and paxinos atlas coordinates
-added code to update cursor in native volume to show mni position
-added code to read native xfm from config file
-added to minc2jiv2.pl:
	use Carp qw( croak );
	-read direction cosines from minc header and write in jiv header
-added many comments & DEBUG statements
-added developer documentation for the confusing stuff that I dealt with
-updated Makefile:
	-> removed all instances of "-depend" and "-deprecation"
-added shell scripts for those who don't have make
-made shell script to run demo (test_run.sh)
	-and increased the available memory to enable reading of large volumes
	-> -Xmx250m
-added more feedback to Main.java for:
	-when user doesn't include config in command line
	-when user doesn't include mni/template or label volumes or .xfm's
-added "demo" directory with all necessary .htm, CONFIG, and volume files for testing
-moved sample .htm & config files from "util" into new directory "samples" under "doc"
-added ability to set "over" and "under" color from config
	-> summary of changes is in CHANGES-COLOR
-added "I" label for intensity text field (DataVolumePanel.java)
-updated to work with java 1.5 (currently default at BIC)

** ver_2_4 [26-apr-2004] :

- inline config feature was in fact buggy! now done properly with a
  separate 'inline_cfg' applet parameter.
- more informative error messages (e.g. when invalid config file).
- bug fix: keyboard shortcuts in 2D viewports now work properly.


** ver_2_3  [07-jul-2002] :

- bug fix: a 1mm slice thickness was assumed by the commands
  changing the displayed slice (+/-, arrows, etc).
- util/jiv.pl : added -force command line switch.


** [21-apr-2002] :

- documentation update: config file can also be provided inline
  within the applet html tag.
- util/minc2jiv.pl : added -force command line switch.


** ver_2_2  [20-dec-2001] :

- new colormap: mni_labels .
- bug fixes related to image-value: negative/zero values, 
  display updating.
- optimization: volumes that don't need resampling or reordering
  now load much faster (important for slow Java platforms, 
  e.g. Netscape on Unix).
- minor optimization in the multi-threading code: JIV may 
  be more responsive on some platforms.


** ver_2_1  [15-nov-2001] :

- bug fix: 'quit' was crashing some browsers.
- minor improvement in the multi-threading code: JIV may 
  be more responsive on some platforms.


** ver_2_0  [8-oct-2001] :

- new features: on_demand and hybrid download modes; support
  for arbitrary sampling of the 3D image data files!


** ver_1_3  [16-may-2001] :

- first public release
