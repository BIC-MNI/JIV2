<title>JIV compatibility information</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>JIV compatibility information</h1>

&quot;JIV&quot; is a <em>Java&nbsp;1.1&nbsp;applet</em>.
Theoretically, it should run on any appletviewer (browsers included)
that properly supports Java&nbsp;1.1 (including AWT&nbsp;1.1), as per
<a href="http://java.sun.com/">Sun</a>'s reference specification.

<p> JIV is quite memory-hungry: every loaded 3D data volume requires
8-9Mb of memory. For faster interactive response, try to use a Java
implementation that has a &quot;just-in-time&quot;&nbsp;(JIT)
compiler.

<p> Generally speaking (i.e. regardless of your particular operating
system / platform), the following should provide full Java&nbsp;1.1
applet support. An (incomplete) platform-specific list follows.

<ul>
  <li>
<dl>
  <dt>Netscape Navigator/Communicator version&nbsp;4.06 or above
      (except on MacOS):
  <dd>available from Netscape (
      <a href="http://www.netscape.com/browsers/">www.netscape.com/browsers/</a>
      ) for a variety of
      platforms (operating systems); a JIT compiler is not used on all
      platforms (e.g. all the Unix versions distributed by Netscape
      don't have it), however some OS vendors may distribute customized
      versions which do include a JIT compiler.
</dl>
  <li>
<dl>
  <dt>Java 1.1.x (or later) plugins for older, non-compliant or slow
      browsers:
  <dd><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/">java.sun.com/products/plugin/</a>
      has links to
      1.1.x (and later) plugins for several platforms; even if your
      browser is Java&nbsp;1.1 compliant, a plugin may provide a more
      performant Java environment (e.g. by including a JIT compiler).
</dl>
  <li>
<dl>
  <dt>&quot;appletviewer&quot; from Sun's Java Development Kit
      (&quot;JDK&quot;) 1.1.x (or later), or from its various ports: 
  <dd>see <a href="http://java.sun.com/jdk/">java.sun.com/jdk/</a>
      for pointers to versions for
      various platforms (versions which are not provided by Sun are
      listed in the &quot;ports&quot; section); also, see below for
      more links to JDK ports.
</dl>
  <li>
<dl>
  <dt>Sun's HotJava web browser:
  <dd>available from
      <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/hotjava/">java.sun.com/products/hotjava/</a>
      , for a handful of
      platforms; this browser is written completely in Java,
      so even if you don't find a version of it for your platform you
      should be able to use it as long as you have a working
      &quot;Java Virtual Machine&quot; (JVM), or
      &quot;Java Runtime Environment&quot; (JRE), implementation.
</dl>
</ul>

<p> The following Java environments were tested and appear to work for
JIV:

<h3>Linux (i386)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><dl>
    <dt>IBM JDK for Linux, version&nbsp;1.1.8 (a port of Sun's JDK)
    <dd>Available at no-cost from 
	<a href="http://www.ibm.com/java/jdk/118/linux/">www.ibm.com/java/jdk/118/linux/</a>.
	It uses a good JIT compiler, and is the recommended platform
	for Linux.
  </dl>
  <li><dl>
    <dt> Netscape Navigator/Communicator 4.6-4.7
    <dd>
  </dl>
  </ul>

<h3>SGI IRIX</h3>
<ul>
  <li><dl>
    <dt>SGI Java Development Environment 3.1.1 (a port of Sun's JDK 1.1.6)
    <dd>Available at no-cost from
	<a href="http://www.sgi.com/Products/Evaluation/6.x_jdk_3.1.1/">www.sgi.com/Products/Evaluation/6.x_jdk_3.1.1/</a>.
	It has a JIT compiler, and is the recommended platform for IRIX 6.x.
  </dl>
  <li><dl>
    <dt>Netscape Navigator/Communicator 4.08 and later
    <dd><!-- do any of the sgi-customized versions have jit compilers?? -->
  </dl>
</ul>
Other versions of SGI JDK, Java plugins and Netscape browsers are available from 
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/Products/Evaluation/">www.sgi.com/Products/Evaluation/</a>
(released versions), and
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/developers/devtools/languages/java.html">www.sgi.com/developers/devtools/languages/java.html</a>
(development/beta versions).
  
<h3>Windows 95/98/NT/2000</h3>
<ul>
  <li><dl>
    <dt> Netscape Navigator/Communicator 4.6-4.7
    <dd> This uses a fast JIT compiler by Symantec.
  </dl>
  <li><dl>
    <dt> IBM JDK for Windows, version&nbsp;1.1.8 (a port of
	Sun's JDK)
    <dd> Available at no-cost from
      <a href="http://www.ibm.com/java/jdk/118/">www.ibm.com/java/jdk/118/</a>.
  </dl>
  <li><dl>
    <dt> Microsoft Internet Explorer version&nbsp;4 and above, with
	Microsoft Java VM&nbsp;version&nbsp;5.0&nbsp;<em>build&nbsp;3167</em>
	(or later)
    <dd>(older Microsoft Java&nbsp;VM versions, which were shipped
	with IE4 and with some early IE5 versions, will <em>not</em> do!)
  </dl>
</ul>

<h3>MacOS (PowerPC)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><dl>
    <dt> Apple MRJ (Mac OS Runtime for Java) version&nbsp;2.2

    <dd> Available at no-cost from
	<a href="http://www.apple.com/java/">www.apple.com/java/</a>.
	It provides a JVM compatible with Sun's JDK&nbsp;1.1.8, 
	and can be used in two ways:
	<ul>
	  <li>by using the &quot;Applet Runner&quot; 
	      bundled with it.
	  <li>by configuring a web browser to use it (MRJ)
	      as its Java engine. Cooperating browsers include:
	      Sun's HotJava, iCab (available from
	      <a href="http://www.icab.de">www.icab.de</a>),
	      and Microsoft Internet Explorer version&nbsp;4 or later. 
	</ul>
  </dl>
  <li><dl>
    <dt> Netscape Navigator/Communicator will <em>not</em> do.
    <dd> (since it doesn't fully support Java AWT 1.1)
  </dl>
</ul>
