\section{Program Design and Organization}

\subsection{Overview}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The overall design is an object-oriented one. The class
  hierarchy (presented in section~\ref{sec:tree}) attempts to separate
  the common parts of different classes, where possible.
  
  The object interfaces (i.e.\ the inter-class communication) are
  using Java~1.1~AWT's \linebreak \texttt{ImageProducer/ImageObserver}
  and \texttt{EventProducer/EventListener} models.  This makes it easy
  to further expand (and possibly reuse) the software, and to
  interchangeably use \mbox{standard} Java AWT user-interface \&
  image-processing components or custom-written components (AWT is the
  graphical/user-interface part of the standard Java~1.x API).
  
\item Most basic graphical user interface (GUI) building blocks
  (components) are provided by AWT\@.  
  A peculiarity of AWT is that it uses the GUI components provided by
  the underlying platform; while this makes it easier for the user, it
  also makes it harder for the programmer (testing only on one Java
  environment is definitely not enough).

\item Individual volume images are processed and displayed in 8-bit
  indexed-color mode (see figure~\ref{fig:IndividualDataVolumePanel})
  --- in fact, in the JIV input file format the voxel data (intensity
  level) is 8-bit anyway. Moreover, this way the colormap adjustments
  only need to change the palette: it's much faster to change 256
  values rather than $181 \times 217$~!
  
  Combined (blended) volume images are processed and displayed in true
  color mode (see figure~\ref{fig:CombinedDataVolumePanel}) --- color
  blendings/transitions wouldn't look good if reduced to 256 (8-bit)
  colors.

\item Internally, the cursor position is stored as world coordinates
  (float values); this offers more flexibility for future functionality.
  However, inside the slice viewports the visible (cross-hair) cursor
  snaps to the center of the voxels.
  
\item For efficiency reasons, the receivers (listeners) of
  \texttt{PositionEvent}-s are not required to check the range of the
  new position coordinates received.  Thus, it is the responsibility
  of the class generating (sending) such events not to send
  coordinates outside the valid range of the 3D data volume.
  
\item In the image viewports (class \texttt{Slice2DViewport}), AWT
  functions are used for the actual image clipping and scaling (this
  also speeds up the execution, because these functions are generally
  implemented by native code libraries). However, the double-buffering
  of the image viewports had to be explicitly implemented.
  
  Also, a clip window is computed for cross-hair cursor and
  distance-measurement updates. But no clip window is specified for
  slice change, zoom, pan, and viewport resize operations (not a big
  problem, since usually for these operations there isn't much more
  extra screen space, hence the rendering/blit CPU cycles saving won't
  be significant).
  
  The interpolation method used for 2D image scaling is
  nearest-neighbour (provided by AWT). This was chosen mainly for
  interactive speed reasons.
  
\item In the 2D slice viewports, the field of view (FOV), in the
  original image space, is preserved (and centered) when the viewport
  is resized (e.g. when the JIV window is resized). Also, FOV's center
  is maintained when performing zoom-in/out (i.e.\ when changing the
  scale factor).

\item When there are several input volumes with different sampling,
  they are resampled internally to a common sampling during loading (see
  \texttt{VolumeHeader.java} and \texttt{Data3DVolume.java}).

\item The \emph{on-demand} and \emph{hybrid} data download is
  implemented using multiple parallel threads, having a lower
  scheduling priority than the main threads (but not all Java
  runtime environments honor thread priorities...).
  
\item The error handling makes extensive use of Java's elegant
  exception mechanism (\verb+throw+\ and \verb+catch+). Invalid user
  inputs is handled by reverting to the previous (valid) value, or to
  a default value.

\item The code can be divided into two broad groups, based on how it's
  executed:
  \begin{description}
  \item[Initialization:] Code that parses the config file, loads the
    image data, and builds the entire graphical user interface (GUI)
    according to the config file (this includes registering ``event
    listeners'' for all the user-triggered GUI events that we care
    about). After all this is completed, JIV goes to sleep waiting for
    events --- from now on, all the execution will be event-driven.
  \item[Event Handling:] Code that gets called in response to:
    \begin{description}
    \item[user-triggered GUI events:] ``\texttt{InputEvent} listener''
      functions that update the necessary data structures, then issue
      a request to AWT for the screen to be updated.
    \item[AWT-triggered (re)paint requests:] Functions that get called
      by AWT (in response to requests from JIV itself, or from the
      host graphical/windowing system) whenever parts of the screen
      need to be redrawn. 
    \end{description}
  \end{description}



\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implementation: Problems Encountered}
\label{sec:problems-encountered}

\begin{itemize}
\item Since existing (no-cost) Java compilers do a very poor job at
  optimizing the byte-code, time was spent on hand-optimizing the
  time-consuming bits of the code (needed in order to obtain good
  interactive response of the viewer).
\item In Java there's no way of allocating non-primitive data types
  (objects) on the stack (for local/temporary variables); only a
  reference (pointer) to objects can go on the stack. Moreover, the
  heap memory manager (which uses a garbage-collection model) of
  Java~1.1 runtime environments seems not to be very efficient in
  terms of overhead time and memory usage. Thus, in order to improve
  the response time, and also minimize the memory footprint increase
  during execution, most local object variables that are frequently
  used were manually pre-allocated and reused after that; such
  variables are named \verb+__methodname_variablename+.
\item The development environment used (IBM JDK for Linux,
  version~1.1.8 -- a port of Sun's JDK~1.1.8) has several serious bugs
  in the compiler.  Workarounds had to be found \ldots Also, there's
  also a significant memory leak in one standard AWT class: 
  \verb+java.awt.image.ReplicateScaleFilter+.
%   more: x-platform portability (Win32: popups, auto-repeating
%   keys, MouseEvent bugs, scrollbars returning vals out of range,
%   \ldots)
  
\item The file \verb+jiv/JAVA_NOTES+ (in the source code directory)
  contains more notes about undocumented/obscure issues with the Java
  language and the version 1.1 JDK (Java Development Kit) \ldots

\end{itemize}
