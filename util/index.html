this applet!

Tips:
<ol>
  <li>The (very large) data files displayed by JIV will be
      cached by your web browser if you set its disk-cache size to a
      large enough value.  If a data file is cached locally, it will
      load <em>a lot</em> faster next time when you display it in JIV.
  <li>Some web browsers do <em>not</em> properly free-up the
      allocated memory after the applet is disposed of. Hence, if you
      are starting JIV several times in a row, then your browser's
      process size may become quite large. If this is a problem,
      simply restart the browser to free-up the memory.
